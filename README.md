# **Simple Moving Average**

### A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. It is often used in technical analysis of financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes.
### A process called convolution is used to determine the average over every datapoint in the dataset over a period of time (days).
#### Example : Apple stock for the year 2020-2021 for 20 day period.
